John Wilder Tukey (JWT): chemist, topologist, advisor, information scientist, researcher, statistician, educator, data analyst, executive, died of a heart attack on July 26,2000 , in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The death followed a short illness. He was eighty-five years old.

John Wilder Tukey（JWT）：化学家、拓扑学家、顾问、信息科学家、研究员、统计学家、教育家、数据分析师、执行官，于2000年7月26日在新泽西州新不伦瑞克因心脏病发作去世。他是在一场短暂的疾病之后去世的。他85岁了。

John Tukey's whole life was one of public service, and as the preceding quotes make clear, he had profound influence. He was a member of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee for each of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. He was special in many ways. He merged the scientific, governmental, technological, and industrial worlds more seamlessly than, perhaps, anyone else in the 1900s. His scientific knowledge, creativity, experience, calculating skills, and energy were prodigious. He was renowned for creating statistical concepts and words.

 John Tukey的一生是为公共服务的，正如前面的引语所表明的，他有深远的影响。他是艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪和约翰逊总统的总统科学咨询委员会成员。他在许多方面都很特别。他比20世纪的任何人都更无缝地融合了科学、政府、技术和工业世界。他的科学知识、创造力、经验、计算技巧和精力惊人。他以创造统计概念和单词而闻名。

JWT's graduate work was in mathematics, but driven by World War II, he left that field to go on to revolutionize the world of the analysis of data. At the end of the war he began a joint industrial-academic career at Bell Telephone Laboratories and at Princeton University. Science and the analysis of data were ubiquitous. This split career continued until he retired in 1985. Even after retirement his technical and scientific work continued at a very high level.

JWT研究生时做的是数学，但受第二次世界大战的推动，他离开了这个领域，继续改革数据分析的世界。战争结束时，他在贝尔实验室和普林斯顿大学开始了工业和学术的联合职业生涯。科学和数据分析无处不在。这种分裂的职业生涯一直持续到他1985年退休。即使退休后，他的技术和科学工作仍保持在非常高的水平。

In memorializing John Tukey's life, one has to review his contributions to both science and society. It is further interesting to follow his evolution from mathematician to statistician. The sections of this article are: Narrative of the Professional Life, The Scientific Legacy, Concluding Remarks, and Epilogue. Sidebars list his Ph.D. students and his books.

在纪念约翰·图基的一生时，我们必须回顾他对科学和社会的贡献。跟踪他从数学家到统计学家的演变更有趣。这篇文章的章节分别是：职业生涯、科学遗产和结束语。侧边栏列出了他的博士生和他的书。**【疑问：侧边栏】**

# Narrative of the Professional Life

# 职业生涯

## Chronology

## 年表

John Tukey was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on June 16,1915 . After being schooled precollege at home, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry. For a Ph.D. he went to Princeton, where he quickly switched to mathematics.

约翰·图基于1915年6月16日出生于马萨诸塞州的新贝德福德。在家里接受大学预科教育后，他获得了化学学士和硕士学位。为了获得博士学位，他去了普林斯顿，在那里他很快转向了数学

**Graduate School.** He arrived at Princeton in September 1937. One has the strong impression that John and his friends had a wonderful time during their graduate studies. The Graduate College and Fine Hall, where the mathematics department was located, were very special places. Meals in the Graduate College were taken in academic gowns, and eating groups formed. In the first year JWT was drafted into the "Fuhrocracy" whose members included L. Spitzer, F. Smithies, R. P. Boas, G. W. King, M. Kanner, H. Wallman, and A. Stone. In later years his group included G. W. Brown, Richard Feynman, and O. Morgenstern. His other friends included N. Steenrod, B. MacMillan, and Bill Baker.

**研究生院。** 他于1937年9月到达普林斯顿。人们对John和他的朋友们在研究生学习期间度过的一段美好时光有着深刻的印象。研究生院和数学系所在的费恩厅（Fine Hall）是非常特别的地方。研究生院的饭菜都穿着学位服,**（疑问，应该是比喻研究生院学术氛围浓厚）**吃饭小组也成立了。第一年，JWT被征召到“ Fuhrocracy”，其成员包括L. Spitzer，F.Smithies，R.P.Boas，G.W.King，M.Kanner，H. Wallman和A. Stone。在后来的几年中，他的小组包括G. W. Brown，Richard Feynman和O. Morgenstern。他的其他朋友包括N. Steenrod，B. Macmillan和Bill Baker。

Fine Hall, besides housing the mathematics faculty, was renowned for its library and for tea time in the lounge. The Princeton mathematics faculty at that time included: C. Eisenhart, S. Lefschetz, S. S. Wilks, and A. W. Tucker. The members of the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS), such as John von Neumann, were also housed in Fine Hall then.

费恩厅除了有数学系外，还以图书馆和休息室的茶点时间而闻名。当时普林斯顿的数学系的教员有：C. Eisenhart, S. Lefschetz, S. S. Wilks, and A. W. Tucker。当时高等研究院（IAS，Institute for Advanced Studies）的成员，如John von Neumann（冯·诺依曼），也住在费恩厅。

JWT attended many (all?) mathematics lectures. Of those by Marston Morse on symbolic dynamics, he said that Steenrod and he did their best to keep "Morse honest". Keeping people honest remained a key part of his scientific life. Of a course A. W. Tucker gave in 1938, Tucker once said that every time he gave a definition of a combinatorial manifold, JWT would come up with a counterexample. Tucker further remarked, "It ended in a draw."

JWT参加了许多（全部？）数学讲座。在Marston Morse关于符号动力学（symbolic dynamics）的讲座中，他说Steenrod和他尽了最大努力让Morse“诚实”。让人们诚实仍然是他科学生活的关键部分。JWT参加了A. W. Tucker 1938年的一个课，Tucker说，他每给出一个组合流形（combinatorial manifold）的定义，JWT都会想出一个反例。Tucker进一步评论道，“它以平局告终。”

At the party celebrating the completion of their graduate studies, JWT and Robert Eddy became famous for serving milk rather than the traditional beer. In a story whose authenticity was not denied by JWT, John von Neumann is reputed to have remarked, "There is this very bright graduate student, and the remarkable thing is that he does it all on milk."

在庆祝研究生毕业的派对上，Tukey和Robert Eddy因供应牛奶而不是传统啤酒而出名。在一个Tukey没有否认真实性的故事中，John von Neumann据说说过，“有一个非常聪明的研究生，了不起的是他全靠牛奶做到了。”**【疑问：不太理解全靠牛奶啥意思，不喝酒也能做出成就的玩笑？】**

While living in the Graduate College, John came to know the physicist Richard Feynman, and he appears in various of the books by and about Feynman. One special story relates to keeping time. Feynman knew that he could keep track of time while reading, but not while speaking. He presented this as a challenge. Rising to it, JWT showed that he could speak and keep track of time simultaneously. Of this Feynman remarks: "Tukey and I discovered that what goes on in different people's heads when they think they're doing the same thing-something as simple as counting-is different for different people." This may also be the source of JWT's remark, "People are different."

在研究生院生活时，Tukey认识了物理学家理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman），他出现在Feynman的各种著作中。一个特别的故事与计时有关。Feynman知道他可以在阅读时记录时间，但不能在说话时记录时间。他把这作为一个挑战。Tukey意识到这一点，证明他可以同时说话和记录时间。关于Feynman的评论：“Tukey和我发现，当不同的人认为他们在做同样的事情——像计数这样简单的事情——时，他们的头脑中发生的事情是不同的。”这也可能是Tukey的评论“人是不同的”的来源。

In 1939 Feynman and Tukey, together with Bryant Tuckerman and Arthur Stone, were members of the Flexagon Committee. This group formed directly following the discovery of certain origamilike objects by Stone. Flexagons are folded from strips of paper and reveal different faces as they are flexed. A theory of flexagons was worked out by Tukey and Feynman, the theory being a hybrid of topology and network theory. Feynman created a diagram that showed all the possible paths through a hexaflexagon. The Feynman-Tukey theory was never published, but parts were later rediscovered.

1939年，Feynman和Tukey与Bryant Tuckerman和Arthur Stone组成了Flexagon（[一种用纸折出的多边形](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexagon)）小组。这个小组是由Stone有了某些折纸上的发现后直接成立的。Flexagons是从纸条上折叠起来的，当它们弯曲时，会显示出不同的面孔。Tukey和Feynman提出了一个flexagons理论，该理论是拓扑和网络理论的混合体。Feynman创造了一个图表，显示了通过六边形的所有可能路径。Feynman-Tukey理论从未发表过，但后来部分被重新发现。

**World War II.** In 1941 Tukey was appointed assistant professor of mathematics at Princeton. That year he listed his interests in American Men of Science as point set topology and analysis. With America's entry into World War II, things changed dramatically. John joined the Fire Control Research Office at 20 Nassau Street, Princeton. This organization was concerned with armored vehicle fire control, ballistic behavior of rocket powder, gunfire control, and the accuracy of anti-aircraft stereoscopic height and bomber range finders.

**第二次世界大战。** 1941年，Tukey被任命为普林斯顿大学的数学助理教授。这一年，他在《美国科学人(American Men of Science)》中列出他的兴趣是点集拓扑学和分析。随着美国加入第二次世界大战，事情发生了巨大的变化。Tukey加入了位于普林斯顿纳索(Nassau）街20号的火控研究室（Fire Control Research Office）。这个组织关注的是装甲车的火力控制、火箭火药的弹道行为、火力控制以及防空立体高度和轰炸机测距仪的准确性。

While working there, JWT had countless interactions with Charles P. Winsor (1895-1951), a Harvard engineer with a Ph.D. in physiology. He was referred to as an "engineer-turned-physiologist-turned statistician." To quote John: "It was Charlie and the experience of working on the analysis of real data that converted me to statistics." JWT encountered many others at 20 Nassau Street who went on to renowned careers in statistics. It is hard to know just what the research consisted of, but one finds the following "example" in the Mosteller and Tukey regression book:

在那里工作期间，Tukey与哈佛大学的工程师、生理学博士Charles P. Winsor（1895-1951）有过无数次交流。他被称为“工程师转为生理学家，又转为统计学家”。引用Tukey的话：“是Charles和对真实数据进行分析的经历让我转向了统计学。”Tukey在纳索街20号遇到了许多其他人，他们后来在统计学领域获得了著名的职业生涯。很难确切知道这项研究包括什么，但你可以在Mosteller和Tukey所写的回归方面的书中找到以下“例子”：

> During World War II, in investigating aiming errors made during bomber flights over Europe, one of the research organizations developed a regression equation with several carriers (explanatories). Among its nine or so carriers were altitude, type of aircraft, speed of the bombing group, size of group, and the amount of fighter opposition. On physical grounds, one might expect higher altitudes and higher speeds to produce larger aiming errors. It would not be surprising if different aircraft differed in performance. What the effect of size of group might be can be argued either way. But few people will believe that additional fighter opposition would help a pilot and bombardier do a better job. Nevertheless, amount of fighter opposition appeared as a strong term in the regression equation-the more opposition, the smaller the aiming error. The effect is generally regarded as a proxy phenomenon, arising because the equation had no variable for amount of cloud cover. If clouds obscured the target, the fighters usually did not come up and the aiming errors were ordinarily very large.

>第二次世界大战期间，在调查轰炸机在欧洲上空飞行时的瞄准误差时，一个研究机构用几个变量（解释性）开发了一个回归方程。在它的九个左右的变量中，有高度、飞机类型、轰炸群的速度、机群的规模和战斗机的对抗数。从物理角度来看，人们可能会期望更高的高度和更高的速度会产生更大的瞄准误差。不同的飞机在性能上有所不同，也不足为奇。机群规模的影响可能是什么也可以争论。但是很少有人会相信额外的战斗机对抗会帮助飞行员和投弹手做得更好。然而，在回归方程中，战斗机的对抗数作为一个强项出现——对抗越多，瞄准误差越小。这种效应通常被认为是一种代理现象，因为方程中没有关于云层的变量。如果云层遮蔽了目标，战斗机通常不会上来，瞄准误差通常非常大。

**Bell Telephone Laboratories and Princeton.** In early 1945 "Mr. Tukey" began his long association with Bell Labs, Murray Hill, perhaps the foremost industrial research organization the world has known. He never left. He was full time at the Labs for a very brief period, taking leave from Princeton, but quickly switched to half time at Princeton and half time at the Labs. At the Labs he was in succession member of technical staff, subdepartment head of statistics research, associate executive director communication principles research, and associate executive director information sciences.

**贝尔电话实验室和普林斯顿。** 1945年初，“ Tukey先生”开始了与贝尔实验室默里·希尔（Murray Hill）的长期联系，这也许是世界上最重要的工业研究组织。他从不离开。他在实验室工作了很短的一段时间，从普林斯顿休假，但迅速在普林斯顿进行了半场比赛，在实验室中半场半场。在实验室，他是技术人员，统计研究小组副主任，副执行董事沟通原理研究和副执行主任信息科学主管。

In his parallel career at Princeton, John rose through the ranks to become full professor of mathematics, a position he held 1950-1966. He was first chair of the new statistics department 1966-1970, and professor of statistics from 1966 until his retirement in 1985.

在普林斯顿的平行生涯中，约翰·罗斯（John Rose）晋升为数学教授，他担任了1950-1966年的职位。他担任1966-1970年新统计局的第一任主席，并从1966年到1985年退休。

At the Labs JWT was involved in a myriad of projects. One such project was the Nike missile system, in whose research and development the Bell System played a very substantial role. B. D. Holdbrook and JWT did the aerodynamics, the trajectory, and the warhead design. A collaboration with Ralph Blackman led to two highly influential papers that introduced the engineering and scientific worlds to the computational practice of spectrum analysis. The Labs supported much of his more academic research, as he has acknowledged.

在实验室，JWT参与了无数项目。一个这样的项目就是耐克导弹系统，在其研究和开发中，贝尔系统发挥了非常重要的作用。B. D. Holdbrook和JWT进行了空气动力学，轨迹和弹头设计。与拉尔夫·布莱克曼（Ralph Blackman）的合作导致了两篇高度影响力的论文，这些论文将工程和科学世界引入了频谱分析的计算实践。正如他所承认的那样，实验室支持了他更多的学术研究。

In 1956, Tukey set up the Statistical Techniques Research Group (STRG) at Princeton. The first computer on the Princeton campus was very possibly the IBM 650 at STRG's Gauss House on Nassau Street. Calculation and computers were ever present in JWT's life. The Fire Control Office had one of the first IBM multiplying punches and used it creatively. The classic work by Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann (1946) states in the preface: "The authors also wish to express their thanks to Dr. John Tukey, of Princeton, for many valuable discussions and suggestions." Of just what JWT did Arthur Burks writes:

1956年，Tukey在普林斯顿建立了统计技术研究小组（Strg）。普林斯顿校园的第一台计算机很可能是拿骚街Strg的高斯房屋的IBM 650。JWT的生活中曾经有计算和计算机。消防控制办公室拥有第一个IBM乘以拳，并创造性地使用了拳。Burks，Goldstine和Von Neumann（1946）在序言中说的经典作品：“作者还希望对普林斯顿的John Tukey博士表示感谢，对普林斯顿的John Tukey博士进行了许多宝贵的讨论和建议。” 亚瑟·伯克斯（Arthur Burks）写道：

> John Tukey designed the electronic adding circuit we actually used in the IAS Computer. In this circuit, each binary adder fed its carry output directly into the next stage without delay. ... And this was the circuit actually used because it was reliable and much simpler than the alternative.

> John Tukey设计了我们在IAS计算机中实际使用的电子添加电路。在此电路中，每个二进制加法器将其携带输出直接输入下一阶段。...这是实际使用的电路，因为它比替代方案可靠且简单得多。

**Retirement.** JWT retired from both the Labs and Princeton in 1985 at age seventy. At the retirement event W. O. Baker, retired chair of the board, remarked:

**退休。** JWT于1985年从实验室和普林斯顿退休，享年7岁。董事会退休主席W. O. Baker的退休活动中说：

> John has had an incisive role in each major frontier of telecommunications science and technology: uses of transistors and solid state; digital coding and computers; ...; evolution of software and operations support systems; earth satellite and other microwave techniques; electronic switching; laserbased photonics; topology of integrated circuits; ....

> 约翰在电信科学和技术的每个主要领域都敏锐地作用：晶体管和固态的使用； 数字编码和计算机； ...; 软件和操作支持系统的演变； 地球卫星和其他微波技术； 电子开关； 基于激光的光子学； 综合电路的拓扑； ...

At Princeton JWT became Emeritus Donner Professor of Science and Senior Research Statistician. He further worked as a consultant at places including: Xerox PARC, Bellcore, Merck, the Health Effects Institute, and the Educational Testing Service (ETS).

在普林斯顿，JWT成为名誉唐纳科学教授和高级研究统计学家。他进一步在包括：Xerox Parc，Bellcore，Merck，健康效果研究所和教育测试服务（ETS）的地方担任顾问。

## Contributions to Society

## 对社会的贡献

Through the Bell Labs, Princeton, and Washington connections Tukey's skills became well known to many, and there were countless calls on his time. Throughout the years, he chaired or was a member of countless national panels, particularly ones concerned with protecting the environment. Here I mention some of his most notable activities.

通过贝尔实验室，普林斯顿和华盛顿的连接图基的技能已成为许多人所熟知的，他的时间有无数的电话。多年来，他担任了无数国家小组的主持人或成员，尤其是与保护环境有关的小组成员。在这里，我提到了他最著名的活动。

**The Kinsey Report.** In 1950, following a request, the American Statistical Association assembled a committee to review the statistical problems in Alfred C. Kinsey's work on sex research, work described in his controversial 1948 book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. The members of the committee were W. G. Cochran, F. Mosteller, and JWT. They were concerned particularly with the sampling methods and the absence of controlled randomness.

**金西报告。** 男性。1950年，根据要求，美国统计协会组建了一个委员会，以审查Alfred C. Kinsey在性研究方面的统计问题，这是他在1948年有争议的书《人类男性的性行为》中所描述的。委员会成员是W. G. Cochran，F。Mosteller和JWT。他们特别关注采样方法和没有受控的随机性。

Things did not go well in the committee's interaction with Kinsey. For example, following a dinner at the Kinsey home, Kinsey's wife, Clara, said, "I never fed a group of men that I would have so liked to have poisoned. ... Tukey was the worst." This and other anecdotes may be found in the J.H. Jones biography Alfred C. Kinsey.

在委员会与金西的互动中，情况并不顺利。例如，在金西（Kinsey）的家中晚餐后，金西（Kinsey）的妻子克拉拉（Clara）说：“我从来没有喂一群我想毒的男人。...Tukey是最糟糕的。” 该轶事可以在J.H.中找到。琼斯传记阿尔弗雷德·科尼西（Alfred C. Kinsey）。

**The U-2 Airplane.** The "Cold War" was in full flight in the middle 1950s. One concern was the existence of a "bomber gap" that might enable the USSR to launch a surprise attack. Spurred by such concerns, President Eisenhower created the Killian Committee in 1954. Its Project 3 concerned technical intelligence collection. It was chaired by E. H. Land of Polaroid camera fame and included the astronomer J. G. Baker, the chemist J. W. Kennedy, the engineer A. Latham Jr., the Nobel laureate physicist E. M. Purcell, and JWT. Project 3 recommended the adoption of "a vigorous program for the extensive use ... of the most advanced knowledge in science and technology." The end proposal was to create a high-flying spy plane, and the development of the U-2 followed very quickly. Photos obtained by overflights of the USSR refuted the claims of a bomber gap, but at the same time they gave evidence of efforts to build long-range missiles. I heard it said that it was JWT who suggested the use of titanium in the construction of the bodies of such airplanes.

**U-2飞机。** “冷战”在1950年代中期全面飞行。一个担心的是存在“轰炸机差距”，它可能使苏联能够发动出人意料的攻击。艾森豪威尔（Eisenhower）在此类问题的刺激下，于1954年成立了基利安委员会。其项目3涉及技术情报收集。它由宝丽来相机名望的E. H. Land主持，包括天文学家J. G. Baker，化学家J. W. Kennedy，工程师A. Latham Jr.，诺贝尔奖获得者E. M. Purcell和JWT。项目3建议采用“一项旨在广泛使用科学技术知识的剧烈使用计划”。最终提议是建立一架高空飞行的间谍飞机，U-2的发展很快就遵循。由苏联的越过获得的照片驳斥了轰炸机差距的主张，但与此同时，他们给出了制造远程导弹的努力的证据。我听说它说是JWT建议在此类飞机的尸体建造中使用钛。

In 1957 Eisenhower formed the President's Scientific Advisory Panel partly in response to the effective way that the scientists had dealt with the bomber gap.

1957年，艾森豪威尔（Eisenhower）组成了总统的科学咨询小组，部分原因是科学家对轰炸机差距打交道的有效方式。

**Nuclear Disarmament.** In 1959 JWT spent a month in Geneva, Switzerland, as a U.S. delegate to Technical Working Group 2 of the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests. His expertise, in part, concerned the time series problem of distinguishing earthquakes from nuclear explosions. John's wife, Elizabeth, said once that JWT was the one who suggested that tests might be able to be masked to a degree. This possibility very much startled the Russians.

**核裁军。** 1959年，JWT在瑞士日内瓦度过了一个月，是美国与核武器测试中停用的技术工作组的美国代表。他的专业知识在某种程度上涉及将地震与核爆炸区分开的时间序列问题。约翰的妻子伊丽莎白（Elizabeth）说，曾经是JWT是建议测试可以在一定程度上掩盖的人。这种可能性极大地震惊了俄罗斯人。

JWT has spoken about the difficulties of that period, describing it as a "time of stress ... like a utilities rate case." In 1967 he wrote:

JWT谈到了那个时期的困难，将其描述为“压力的时间……像公用事业费用案例”。1967年，他写道：

> ... resembles my experiences with Geneva ... where the political conference set up technical working groups in the hope that the scientists would settle some of the questions that the politicians could not. ... The politicians' attempt to evade responsibility failed, as was inevitable.

> ...类似于我在日内瓦的经验...政治会议建立技术工作组，希望科学家能解决政客无法做到的一些问题。……政客试图逃避责任的企图失败了，这是不可避免的。

**Psephology-Election Forecasting.** In 1960 RCA/NBC hired a statistical consulting firm to develop a procedure for projecting election results on the basis of partial counts. They involved John Mauchly and JWT amongst others. John Tukey became renowned that year for preventing an early call of victory for Richard Nixon.

**PSEPHOLOGY选举预测。** 1960年，RCA/NBC雇用了一家统计咨询公司，根据部分计数开发了预测选举结果的程序。他们参与了约翰·莫克利（John Mauchly）和JWT等。约翰·图基（John Tukey）因阻止理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）的早期胜利而闻名。

Starting with the 1962 congressional election, John assembled a statistical team to develop required methodology and to analyze the results as they flowed in. In the development of methods, the uncertainty was just as important as the point estimates. It turned out that the problem of projecting turnout was more difficult than that of projecting candidate percentage. The procedures developed might be described as an early example of empirical Bayes, or "borrowing strength", to use JWT's term.

从1962年的国会选举开始，约翰召集了一个统计团队来开发所需的方法论并分析结果。在方法的发展中，不确定性与观点估计一样重要。事实证明，预测投票率的问题比预测候选人百分比要困难。开发的程序可能被描述为使用JWT的术语的经验贝叶斯或“借用强度”的早期例子。

NBC stopped involving John in 1980. One reason was that exit polls, where people are interviewed after they leave a polling station, had gotten refined. One can speculate on what might have happened had JWT been involved with one of the networks in making the Florida projections in the fall of 2000.

NBC在1980年停止参与约翰。一个原因是，出口民意测验，人们在离开投票站后接受了采访。可以推测，如果JWT参与其中一个网络在2000年秋季进行佛罗里达预测，可能会发生什么。

**Education.** JWT was very interested in the effectiveness of education. From 1965 on he was a consultant to ETS in Princeton. He had a long involvement with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is a long-term program of assessing what the inhabitants of the U.S. can do as measured by their performance on exercises at various ages. JWT, Lee Cronbach, Ralph Tyler, Bob Abelson, and Lyle Jones met often in the late 1960s to guide its formation. JWT brought robust procedures, novel ways to measure change, uncertainty estimation, and careful interpretation of the results into the work.

**教育。** JWT对教育的有效性非常感兴趣。从1965年开始，他是普林斯顿ETS的顾问。他长期参与了国家教育进步评估（NAEP），这是一项长期计划，以评估美国居民在各个年龄段的练习中可以衡量的美国居民可以做什么。JWT，Lee Cronbach，Ralph Tyler，Bob Abelson和Lyle Jones在1960年代后期经常见面，以指导其形成。JWT带来了强大的程序，衡量变化的新方法，不确定性估计以及对结果对工作的仔细解释。

**Information Retrieval.** Starting in the mid-1960s, John Tukey sought to bring order to the literature of statistics and probability by constructing indexes of the papers of those fields. He had done extensive work for Mathematical Reviews and prepared bibliographies before, e.g., for time series, and perhaps this is what spurred him on. In particular he constructed a citation index. Regarding that effort, it is impressive to see the roll call of eminent statisticians that JWT recruited to compile the papers and the reference lists. The citation index that was constructed then was one of the earliest outside of the legal profession. JWT constructed other indices as well. These were taken over later by the American Mathematical Society and are part of MathSciNet.

**信息检索。** 从1960年代中期开始，约翰·图基（John Tukey）试图通过构建这些领域论文的索引来为统计和概率文献带来秩序。他在数学评论中做了广泛的工作，并准备了书目，例如时间序列，也许这就是激励他的原因。特别是他构建了引文索引。关于这一努力，令人印象深刻的是，JWT招募了著名的统计学家来编译论文和参考列表。当时构建的引文指数是法律界最早的引文指数之一。JWT也构建了其他指数。这些人后来被美国数学学会接管，是MathScinet的一部分。

After retirement JWT consulted at Xerox PARC. His name, with a variety of co-inventors from that company, appears on quite a number of patents, some of the key words of which are: information access, ordering document clusters, identifying drop words, generating thematic summaries, automatic document summarization, phase query formation.

退休后，JWT在Xerox Parc进行了咨询。他的名字与该公司的各种共同介绍者一起出现在许多专利上，其中一些关键词是：信息访问，订购文档群集，识别掉落单词，生成主题摘要，自动文档摘要，摘要， 相查询组。

**Census Adjustment.** JWT advised the Census Bureau for many years. In 1980 the Census Bureau's step of adjusting the raw values to obtain "improved" estimates became a political issue. Probably to the great surprise of the Bureau, it found itself tangled up in the adversarial setup of the U.S. legal and political systems. This happened because congressional apportionment and the allocation of funds are both based on census counts. The Constitution states, regarding the House of Representatives, "The actual Enumeration shall be made ... in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." This leaves lots of room for argument.

**人口普查调整。** JWT多年来建议人口普查局。1980年，人口普查局调整原始价值以获得“改进”估计的步骤成为政治问题。可能令该局感到惊讶的是，它发现自己在美国法律和政治体系的对抗性设置中纠缠在一起。发生这种情况是因为国会分配和资金分配都是基于人口普查计数。《宪法》关于众议院的宪法“应按照法律直接应采取的方式进行实际枚举。” 这留下了很多争论的余地。

JWT felt that adjustment should be made because errors would be smaller and their direction unpredictable. Regarding the idea that the errors would be smaller, he was perhaps spurred by the success of the borrowing strength procedure in election forecasting.

JWT认为应该进行调整，因为错误会较小，并且其方向不可预测。关于错误会较小的想法，他可能因借用力量程序在选举预测中的成功而激发了他的成功。

**Teaching.** JWT's teaching style was on the oblique side. Indeed, sometimes people wondered if he was being deliberately obscure. It has been suggested that his home schooling background led to some of the difficulties. My personal impression was that he wanted the people with whom he interacted to figure things out on their own, to the degree possible.

**教学。** JWT的教学风格在倾斜方面。确实，有时人们想知道他是否故意晦涩难懂。有人建议他的家庭教育背景带来了一些困难。我个人的印象是，他希望与他互动的人自己弄清楚事情。

The courses he presented at Princeton were state of the art, indeed introducing the art in many cases. The topics included: Monte Carlo, fractional replication, time series,.... Major investigators, such as Cuthbert Daniel, came along to class.

他在普林斯顿大学开设的课程是最艺术的，确实在许多情况下引入了艺术。主题包括：蒙特卡洛，分数复制，时间序列，...。

John's interactions with students often took place at the house on Arreton Road, particularly on Saturdays. In particular he believed that gardening was a social activity.

约翰与学生的互动经常在阿勒顿路（Arreton Road）的房屋中进行，尤其是在星期六。他特别认为园艺是一项社会活动。

John was always very busy. In one period of his life, to deal with obligations in Washington and elsewhere, he scheduled four classes each week. Then he picked the three times that were the most convenient for the week at hand. Another method was to schedule classes for, say, 2:00-4:00 p.m. Tuesday/Thursday instead of the usual 2:00-3:15 p.m., and to skip a class sometimes and at other times to run it for two hours.

约翰总是很忙。在他一生的一个时期，他要处理华盛顿和其他地方的义务，每周安排四个班级。然后，他选择了三次最方便的一周。另一种方法是安排下午2：00-4：00的课程。星期二/星期四，而不是通常的2：00-3：15下午15点，有时会跳过一堂课，有时会跑两个小时。

# The Scientific Legacy

# 科学遗产

## Mathematics

## 数学

JWT's contributions to mathematics proper were pre-World War II. They evidenced the mathematical ability that stood him in such good stead in his statistical and scientific work.

JWT对数学适当的贡献是第二次世界大战。他们证明了在他的统计和科学工作中使他如此稳定的数学能力。

His thesis, "On denumerability in topology", was submitted in 1939, nominally under the supervision of Lefschetz. Part of it later appeared in 1942 in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series under the title Convergence and Uniformity in Topology. Chapter 3 was never published because of overlap with work of M. M. Day.

他的论文“关于拓扑的剥夺性”，于1939年在Lefschetz的监督下提交了他的论文。它的一部分后来出现在1942年的《数学研究年鉴》系列中，标题是拓扑结合的标题和统一性。第3章从未出版，因为与M. M. Day的工作重叠。

The principal part of the thesis was a formulation of uniformity in topology. JWT was seeking to extend convergence techniques to general spaces. The structures have three distinct, but equivalent, definitions via: Weil's pseudometrics, Bourbaki's entourages, and Tukey's families of covers. Appearing in the thesis is the so-called TeichmüllerTukey Lemma: "Every nonempty collection of finite character has a maximal set with respect to inclusion." This lemma is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. Also in his book JWT christens Zorn's Lemma.

论文的主要部分是拓扑中均匀性的表述。JWT试图将收敛技术扩展到一般空间。这些结构具有三个不同但同等的定义，可以通过：Weil的伪测量学，Bourbaki的随行人员和Tukey的封面家庭。出现在论文中的是所谓的TeichmüllerTukey窃听：“每个有限特征的收藏都在包容方面都有最大的设定。” 这种引理等同于选择的公理。同样在他的书JWT Christens Zorn的引理中。

Tukey's approach was used extensively by J. R. Isbell and N. R. Howse in their books. Howse recently wrote me:

Tukey的方法在他们的书中被J. R. Isbell和N. R. Howse广泛使用。Howse最近写信给我：

> ... But Tukey's contribution in this area went beyond showing us how we should think about uniform spaces. His insight was almost prophetic. He sensed that the most interesting uniform spaces were the ones that were fully normal.... Tukey predicted that the fully normal uniform spaces would play a major role in mathematics, and indeed they have.

> ...但是Tukey在这一领域的贡献不仅仅是向我们展示了我们应该如何考虑统一空间。他的见识几乎是预言。他感觉到，最有趣的统一空间是完全正常的空间。...Tukey预测，完全正常的均匀空间将在数学中起主要作用，而且实际上它们具有。

D. H. Fremlin wrote:

D. H. Fremlin写道：

> Of course Tukey's ideas on partial orders did have great influence on me. This was really through J. R. Isbell. Steve Todorovic took the same ideas much further ... I still believe that Tukey's notion of cofinal equivalence gives fundamental insight into some important questions in set-theoretic analysis.

> 当然，Tukey对部分订单的想法确实对我有很大的影响。这确实是通过J. R. Isbell。史蒂夫·托德罗维奇（Steve Todorovic）进一步采取了相同的想法……我仍然相信，图基的Cofinal等价概念使人们对固定理论分析的一些重要问题提供了基本的见解。

There are papers with R. P. Boas and with A. Stone as well as solo-authored articles. The one with Stone, titled "Generalized sandwich theorems", showed that the volumes of any $n$ solids in $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ can be simultaneously bisected by an $(n-1)$ sphere, with a plane able to be regarded as a sphere of infinite radius. The Ham Sandwich Theorem is the case of $n=3$.

有R. P. Boas和A. Stone以及独奏作品的文章的论文。一块石头，标题为“广义三明治定理”，表明$\mathbf{R}^{n}$中的任何$n$ solids的数量可以与$（n-1）$ sphere同时分配 一个能够被视为无限半径的球体。火腿三明治定理是$ n = 3 $的情况。

## Statistics

## 统计学

> Statistics is a science, not a branch of mathematics, but uses mathematical models as an essential tool.

> JWT

> 统计学是一门科学，而不是数学的分支，而是使用数学模型作为必不可少的工具。

> JWT

The Mosteller-Tukey bombing example mentioned above gives an indication of the difficulties of interpretation of results that statisticians deal with regularly in the world of experiments and data. JWT's statistical contributions reflect his struggles with that often messy world. Some highlights follow.

上面提到的大多数人抗议炸弹示例表明了统计学家在实验和数据世界中定期处理结果的解释困难。JWT的统计贡献反映了他在那个杂乱无章的世界中的斗争。有一些亮点。

**Robustness.** Robustness refers to the property of a procedure remaining effective even in the absence of usual assumptions such as normality and no incorrect data values. In simplest terms the idea is to improve upon the use of the simple arithmetic average in estimating the center of a distribution. As a simple case one can ask: Is it ever better to use the sample median than the sample mean, and if so, when?

**鲁棒性。** 鲁棒性是指程序的属性，即使没有通常的假设，例如正态性和不正确的数据值，也是有效的。用最简单的话来说，想法是改善使用简单算术平均值来估计分布中心的使用。作为一个简单的情况，人们可以提出：使用样品中位数比样品平均值更好，如果是，什么时候？

Tukey had gotten interested in the problem of robustness in the last stages of his work at 20 Nassau Street. He remarked that C. P. Winsor taught him to beware of extreme deviates. The two learned, for example, that if you add $0.1$ percent of a Gaussian three times as spread out as a basic Gaussian, then the mean deviation does better than the classic standard deviation as a way of measuring scale.

Tukey对在拿骚街20号工作的最后阶段的鲁棒性问题感兴趣。他指出，C。P。Winsor教他提防极端偏差。例如，两人了解到，如果您将高斯的0.1美元的$ 0.1 $占基本高斯的分布，那么平均偏差的确比经典的标准偏差更好地作为测量量表的方式。

An important part of JWT's contribution was developing particular forms of problem distributions, those displaying the difficulties that occurred in practice. The ones employed included the mixture of Gaussians, the slash, and the $g-h$.

JWT贡献的一个重要部分是开发特定的问题分布形式，那些表现出在实践中发生的困难的人。所使用的人包括高斯人，斜线和$ G-H $的混合物。

For the smoothing case he recommended running medians. This tool has proved exceedingly useful in image processing.

对于平滑案例，他建议跑步中位数。事实证明，该工具在图像处理中非常有用。

**Time Series.** During World War II, JWT had become acquainted with Norbert Wiener's seminal work, later published in book form.

**时间序列。** 在第二次世界大战期间，JWT熟悉了诺伯特·维纳（Norbert Wiener）的开创性作品，后来以书籍形式出版。

JWT has told the story of how he got interested in the spectral analysis of time series. Just after the war, a Bell Laboratories engineer working on tracking radars was heading to a conference and wished to show a slide of an estimated power spectrum. He met with Tukey and Richard Hamming. Those two knew the Fourier relation between the autocovariance function and the spectrum and took the Fourier transform of the sample autocovariance function. The estimate was seen to ripple. This led Hamming to make the suggestion that the engineer's estimate would look better were it smoothed, for example via the weights $0.25,0.50,0.25$. The result was a striking success and led to JWT's major involvement in the field of time series analysis.

JWT讲述了他如何对时间序列的光谱分析感兴趣的故事。战争结束后，一名贝尔实验室工程师致力于跟踪雷达，并希望展示估计的功率谱的幻灯片。他遇到了Tukey和Richard Hamming。这两个知道自相关函数和光谱之间的傅立叶关系，并采用了样品自动助力函数的傅立叶变换。估计被认为是涟漪。这导致锤子提出了一个建议，即工程师的估计值会更好，例如，通过权重$ 0.25,0.50.50,0.25 $。结果是取得了惊人的成功，并导致了JWT参与时间序列分析领域的主要参与。

Tukey often argued the advantages in favor of the power spectrum over the autocorrelation. Such an argument is needed because the two are mathematically equivalent. He claimed that the analyst could learn more from a spectral analysis, particularly in discovering unexpected phenomena.

图基经常争辩说优于自相关的优势。之所以需要这样的论点，是因为两者在数学上是等效的。他声称分析师可以从光谱分析中学到更多，尤其是在发现意外现象时。

Bogert, Healey, and Tukey introduced cepstral analysis as a way to address the problem of distinguishing an earthquake from an explosion [1]. This was based on the observation that a signal laid on top of itself with a delay leads to a rippling spectrum. The delay may be estimated as the frequency of the ripple and from that the depth of the seismic event. A lot of colorful language, like "saphe cracking", "quefrency", and "alanysis" was also introduced in that paper. Of the language Dick Hamming remarked to John that "from now on you will be known as J. W. Cutie." The cepstrum was quite unlike any time series quantity that had been proposed previously.

Bogert，Healey和Tukey引入了Cepstral分析，以解决将地震与爆炸区分开的问题[1]。这是基于这样的观察结果，即信号自身延迟会导致波纹频谱。延迟可以估计为纹波的频率和地震事件的深度。该论文还引入了许多色彩斑点的语言，例如“ Saphe Cracking”，“ Quefrency”和“ Alanysis”。迪克·哈明（Dick Hamming）在语言中对约翰说：“从现在开始，您将被称为J. W. Cutie”。Cepstrum与以前提出的任何时间序列数量完全不同。

Nearly all of the time series papers may be found in Volumes I and II of the Collected Works.

几乎所有时间序列的论文都可以在收集作品的第I和II卷中找到。

**Data Analysis.** JWT had a philosophy for studying experimental results from early on. He called it data analysis. One of his descriptions was the following:

**数据分析。** JWT具有研究早期实验结果的理念。他称其为数据分析。他的描述之一是以下内容：

> ... data analysis which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.

> ...我要包括的数据分析，除其他外：分析数据的过程，解释此类过程结果的技术，计划收集数据的方法，以使其分析更容易，更精确或更准确，并且 （数学）统计的所有机械和结果，适用于分析数据。

His 1962 paper on the subject changed the paradigm and language of statistics. His 1977 book made the techniques available to a very broad audience. JWT recognized two types of data analysis: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). In the former the data are sacred while in the latter the model is sacred. In EDA the principal aim is to see what the data are "saying". It is used to look for unexpected patterns in data. In CDA one is trying to disconfirm a previously identified indication, hopefully doing this on fresh data. It is used to decide whether data confirm hypotheses the study was designed to test.

他的1962年有关该主题的论文改变了统计的范式和语言。他1977年的书使这些技术可用于非常广泛的观众。JWT识别两种类型的数据分析：探索性数据分析（EDA）和验证性数据分析（CDA）。在前者中，数据是神圣的，而在后者中，模型是神圣的。在EDA中，主要目的是查看数据是什么“说”。它用于寻找数据中的意外模式。在CDA中，One试图否认先前确定的迹象，希望在新的数据上这样做。它用于确定数据是否确认假设该研究旨在测试。

Some parts of EDA are ugly, but the real world is ugly, particularly when errors and other aberrant material enters a data set.

EDA的某些部分很丑陋，但是现实世界很丑陋，尤其是当错误和其他异常材料进入数据集时。

**Statistical Graphics.**

**统计图**

> The best single device for suggesting, and at times answering, questions beyond those originally posed is the graphical display.

> JWT

> 最佳建议的最佳单一设备，有时是回答最初提出的问题的问题是图形显示。

> JWT

E. Tufte has remarked of Tukey's work on graphics that "he made the field respectable." In particular one can mention JWT's paper at the Vancouver International Congress of Mathematicians.

塔夫特（E. Tufte）指出，图基（Tukey）在图形上的工作“他使该领域受到尊重”。特别是可以在温哥华国际数学家大会上提及JWT的论文。

Statistical graphics are a critical part of EDA. Tukey's boxplots and stem-and-leaf diagrams now appear throughout scientific presentations and high-school texts. A field that he popularized is dynamic graphics. Following Tukey's direction a display program, PRIM-9, was developed at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) for looking at multidimensional data. It was based on point cloud rotation and associated dynamic operations. Nowadays point cloud rotation is basic to statistical packages. One difficulty was which direction to rotate to. JWT proposed the procedure of projection pursuit to handle this. It seeks 1 and 2 dimensional projections of multivariate data, looking for data points that concentrate near intermediatedimensional manifolds.

统计图形是EDA的关键部分。Tukey的框图和茎图图现在出现在整个科学演示和高中文本中。他普及的领域是动态图形。在Tukey的方向下，在SLAC（斯坦福线性加速器中心）开发了一个显示程序PRIM-9，用于查看多维数据。它基于点云旋转和相关的动态操作。如今，云旋转是统计软件包的基础。一个困难是要旋转哪个方向。JWT提出了预测追求的程序来处理这一点。它寻求多元数据的1和2尺寸投影，寻找集中在介于中介二维流形附近的数据点。

JWT's last book, written together with Basford, was titled The Graphical Analysis of Multivariate Data. It contained novel graphical procedures and his current views on the problem of multiple comparisons.

JWT的最后一本书与Basford一起编写，标题为多元数据的图形分析。它包含了新的图形程序以及他对多次比较问题的当前观点。

**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).** ANOVA and regression are the workhorses of statistics, and JWT made many important contributions to each of them. An assumption of additivity is basic, and JWT was concerned with how to examine that assumption in practice. He remarked, "I carried the problem about how to do something about removable non-additivity 'in my pocket' for at least two years before the right idea dawned." The idea was to work with a bilinear expansion in the additive parts. The resulting paper was titled "One degree of freedom for additivity".

**差异分析（ANOVA）。** ANOVA和回归是统计的工作主场，JWT对每个人都做出了许多重要的贡献。添加性的假设是基本的，JWT关注如何在实践中检查该假设。他说：“在正确的想法浮出水面之前，至少两年来，我提出了有关如何在口袋里做些不可添加的问题的问题。” 这个想法是在添加零件中进行双线性扩展。由此产生的论文标题为“添加性的一种自由度”。

Another novel idea of his was dyadic ANOVA, an analysis of variance for vectors. To develop a multivariate analysis of variance he worked with the inner product of the data vector with an abstract-valued vector of the same length.

他的另一个新颖的想法是二元方差分析，这是对向量方差的分析。为了开发对方差的多元分析，他与数据向量的内部产品合作，具有相同长度的抽象值矢量。

**Multiple Comparisons.** In many statistical situations there is a concern to control the error rate of statements being made. Difficulties arise if one gives in to temptations associated with the application of a number of tests to the same data set, as in asking several questions at the same time, or in carrying out several analyses of the same data set.

**多重比较。** 在许多统计情况下，有一个关注的问题可以控制所作的陈述错误率。如果人们屈服于与在同一数据集中应用许多测试相关的诱惑，例如同时提出几个问题，或者在进行相同数据集的几个分析时，就会出现困难。

This is another problem that JWT acknowledged working on for a number of years before developing a solution. He actually commented once on how few papers he had written during that period. His solution was developed in a famous 1953 unpublished manuscript, "The problem of multiple comparisons". It now appears in the Collected Works.

这是JWT在开发解决方案之前认可的另一个问题。实际上，他曾经评论过他在那个时期写的论文很少。他的解决方案是在1953年著名的未发表手稿“多重比较的问题”中开发的。现在出现在收集的作品中。

The Tukey technique is often seen under the rubric of the "honestly significantly difference" (HSD) test, another term that is JWT's. In later years JWT moved on to using the false discovery rate (FDR) of Benjamini and Hochsted when many things were being compared.

Tukey技术通常是在“诚实差异”（HSD）测试的标题下看到的，这是JWT的另一个术语。在后来的几年中，当比较许多事情时，JWT继续使用本杰米尼和霍奇斯特的错误发现率（FDR）。

**The Jackknife.**  This is a tool that Tukey proposed and used for CDA over many years. In naive terms it provides an indication of the uncertainty of an estimate by judiciously combining estimates based on subsets of the full data set.

**刀切法。** 这是Tukey多年来建议和用于CDA的工具。从天真的角度来看，它通过根据完整数据集的子集明智地组合估计来表明估计值的不确定性。

He called the procedure the jackknife because

他称该程序为刀切法，因为

> The procedure ... shares two characteristics with a Boy Scout Jackknife: (1) wide applicability to very many different problems, and (2) inferiority to special tools for those problems for which special tools have been designed and built.

> 该过程...与童子军折刀共享两个特征：（1）针对许多不同的问题的广泛适用性，以及（2）针对设计和构建特殊工具的特殊工具的自卑。

It provides uncertainty analyses when exact estimates are unavailable.

当不可用的确切估计值时，它提供了不确定性分析。

**Other Contributions.** JWT successfully pushed for applications of statistical methods to a wide variety of fields. To mention a few: economics, aeronautics, geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, space science, and astrophysics.

**其他贡献。** JWT成功地将统计方法应用于各种领域。提到一些：经济学，航空，地球物理学，海洋学，气象，太空科学和天体物理学。

Brief mention may also be made of JWT's novel contributions to: mathematical statistics, quality assurance, theory of games, and medical statistics. There is much that remains unpublished, including various Princeton course notes, working papers, and technical reports. It is a shame that work ended on his Collected Works, which brought various unpublished items into public view.

**其他贡献。** JWT成功地将统计方法应用于各种领域。提到一些：经济学，航空，地球物理学，海洋学，气象，太空科学和天体物理学。

## Computation

## 计算

**Head/hand Methods.** The arithmetic skills of Feynman and von Neumann are legendary, and Tukey had these too. In particular he developed a variety of quick methods for carrying out statistical analyses in real time. These were basic to his consulting work. He spoke of "using pen, paper, and slide rule." There are a variety of his numerical short cuts presented in the EDA book.

**头部/手方法。** 特别是他开发了各种快速方法来实时进行统计分析。这些是他的咨询工作的基础。他谈到“使用笔，纸和幻灯片规则”。EDA书中有各种各样的数字捷径。

JWT was a member of the Supervising Scientific Committee of the highly influential handbook of mathematical functions edited by Abramowitz and Stegun. The story was the suggestions were all generated spontaneously during a single lunch meeting.

JWT是Abramowitz和Stegun编辑的高度影响力手册的监督科学委员会成员。这个故事是在一次午餐会上自发产生的建议。

**Monte Carlo/Simulation.** JWT made contributions to the techniques of Monte Carlo. In 1956 Trotter and Tukey introduced the technique of conditional Monte Carlo wherein one estimates an integral of a weighted function by simple Monte Carlo, instead of the integral of the function itself. This is a means of variance reduction. In it one imbeds the sample space in a larger one.

**蒙特卡洛/模拟。** JWT为蒙特卡洛的技术做出了贡献。1956年，托特（Trotter）和图基（Tukey）引入了条件蒙特卡洛（Monte Carlo）的技术，其中一个人估计了简单的蒙特卡洛（Monte Carlo）的加权功能的积分，而不是功能本身的积分。这是降低方差的手段。在其中，将样品空间嵌入了较大的空间。

He also introduced polysampling wherein a single set of samples is able to produce estimates of means and standard errors under two, three, ... different distributions at the same time by combining the sample with two, three, ... sets of weights.

他还引入了多绘制采样，其中一组样品能够通过将样品与两个，三个，...的权重相结合，从而在两个，三个，不同的分布下产生均值和标准误差的估计。

**Fourier Analysis.** JWT had picked up on the Gibbs phenomenon and the practical need for convergence factors early on. He also wrote concerning the difficulties of interpretation such as those caused by aliasing.

**傅立叶分析。** JWT已经对Gibbs现象进行了挑选，并且早期对收敛因子的实际需求。他还写了有关解释困难的文章，例如由混蛋引起的。

In lectures at Princeton in 1963 he showed that if one wished the discrete Fourier transform of a sequence of $N$ numbers, then when $N=G H$, the computation of the empirical Fourier transform required only $(H+2+G) G H$ multiplications. He further remarked that for $N=4^{k}$ one needed fewer than $2 N+N \log _{2} N$. The resulting Cooley-Tukey paper, [3], has become a citation classic. When it popularized the FFT, signal processing very quickly switched from analog to digital.

在1963年在普林斯顿的演讲中，他表明，如果人们希望$ n $数字的离散傅立叶变换，那么当$ n = g h $时，经验傅立叶变换的计算仅需$（H+2+G） G H $乘法。他进一步指出，对于$ n = 4^{k} $，一个人需要少于$ 2 n+n \ log _ {2} n $。由此产生的cooley-tukey纸[3]已成为引文经典。当它普及FFT时，信号处理非常迅速地从模拟转换为数字。

There is one sad aspect to the FFT story. On numerous occasions JWT made remarks of the type, "Gordon Sande ... had purely independently found an algorithm to reach the same effect." He clearly felt bad about Sande's not receiving some share of the credit.

FFT故事有一个可悲的方面。在许多情况下，JWT对“戈登·桑德……纯粹独立地发现了一种算法达到相同效果”的言论。他显然对桑德没有获得信用的一部分感到难过。

Another side of Tukey's FFT work was his and his collaborators' finding novel applications of the algorithm(s).

Tukey FFT工作的另一面是他和他的合作者在算法中找到了新颖的应用。

## Tukey Neologisms

## Tukey Neologisms

John Tukey was famous for creating new words and new uses for old ones. He said that he did this to avoid confusions.

约翰·图基（John Tukey）以创造新单词和新用途而闻名。他说，他这样做是为了避免困惑。

He is said to have introduced the terms: "bit", "linear programming", "ANOVA", "Colonel Blotto", and was first into print with "software". Of these efforts L. Hogben and M. Cartwright wrote, "The introduction by Tukey of bits for binary digits has nothing but irresponsible vulgarity to commend it." Tukey's word "polykay" was described as "linguistic miscegenation" by Kendall and Stuart because of its combining a Greek prefix with a Latin suffix. JWT did it again later with "polyspectrum".

据说他介绍了术语：“ BIT”，“线性编程”，“ ANOVA”，“上校Blotto”，并首先使用“软件”打印。在这些努力中，L。Hogben和M. Cartwright写道：“ Tukey for Binary for Binary Digits的介绍只有不负责任的粗俗来表彰它。” 肯德尔（Kendall）和斯图尔特（Stuart）将图基（Tukey）的单词“ polykay”描述为“语言误差”，因为它的希腊前缀与拉丁语后缀相结合。JWT稍后再用“ Polyspectrum”再次做到了这一点。

His own name led to some amusing confusions. In 1980 NASA sponsored a symposium on using robotics to explore space using self-replicating systems. (Feynman and JWT were among the attendees.) Coming out of the discussion was "Tukey's ratio"-the fraction of total necessary resources that must be supplied by some external agency. It was also referred to in that report as the "Turkey Ratio".

他自己的名字引起了一些有趣的困惑。1980年，NASA赞助了使用机器人技术使用自我复制系统探索空间的研讨会。（Feynman和JWT是与会者之一。）讨论中的是“ Tukey的比率”  - 某些外部机构必须提供的总必要资源的一部分。该报告中也称其为“土耳其比率”。

## The Collected Works

## 收集的作品

Many of the Tukey papers, as well as a number of previously unpublished works, may be found in The Collected Works of John W. Tukey published by Wadsworth, Belmont. These volumes were Bill Cleveland's wonderful prescient idea. There are JWT's and editors' forewords discussing various of the individual papers.

许多Tukey论文以及许多以前未发表的作品都可以在Belmont Wadsworth发表的John W. Tukey收集的作品中找到。这些卷是比尔·克利夫兰（Bill Cleveland）的出色见识。有JWT和编辑的前言讨论各种个人论文。

There are a partially complete curriculum vitae, a list of coauthors, and a bibliography of his works in [2]. Papers are still appearing. JWT has more than 105 coauthors, the most joint works being with Fred Mosteller. There is a Bell Labs website containing a variety of materials related to John, including personal reminiscences [4]. There is an oral history with JWT and others mentioning him [5].

有部分完整的课程，合着者的名单以及他在[2]中的作品的参考书目。论文仍在出现。JWT拥有105多名合着者，这是与弗雷德·莫斯特勒（Fred Mosteller）的最合作作品。有一个贝尔实验室网站，其中包含与约翰有关的各种材料，包括个人回忆[4]。JWT有一个口述历史，其他人提到他[5]。

## Epilogue

## 结语

John Tukey was a giant of a scientist and public servant. He was an academic who liked to argue and expected to win. But at the same time he was the most generous, patient, caring soul.

约翰·图基（John Tukey）是科学家和公务员的巨人。他是一个喜欢争论并希望获胜的学者。但是与此同时，他是最慷慨，耐心，关怀的灵魂。

When my elder son died after a twenty-year struggle with a brain tumor and JWT heard of his death, he telephoned. He was weeping away.

当我的大儿子在与脑肿瘤的二十年斗争中去世，JWT听说他的死亡时，他打电话给他。他在哭泣。

JWT dealt with his own personal grief when his wife Elizabeth died; he wrote some very special words:

当他的妻子伊丽莎白去世时，JWT处理了自己的悲伤。他写了一些非常特别的话：

> One is so much less than two.

> 一个小于两个。
